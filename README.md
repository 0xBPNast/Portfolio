## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Mechanical Engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, optimization; passionate about using data to drive insight and innovation.
Actively seeking to pivot my career to everything data!

- 💡 Skilled in problem solving, always looking for innovative solutions and new ways of thinking
- 🔍 Experienced in feature engineering, model selection & model tuning (although this is pretty specific to conventional engineering applications still!)
- 🧰 Proficient in transforming messy data into actionable insights, especially when centering these problems around business

📍 Based in JHB, South Africa<br>
🚀 Open to roles in data science, ML engineering, or data platform development (remote or on-site)
